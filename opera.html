    <h3>The Gondoliers</h3>
    <h4>ACT II Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h4>
       <h4> SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
   Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
   occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
   are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
   etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
   degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
   distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
   reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.</h4>

                             RECITATIVE—DUKE.

    <p>To help unhappy commoners, and add to their enjoyment,
    Affords a man of noble rank congenial employment;
    Of our attempts we offer you examples illustrative:
    The work is light, and, I may add, it's most remunerative.</p>

                    DUET—DUKE and DUCHESS.

<h5>DUKE.</h5>         <p> Small titles and orders
              For Mayors and Recorders
                   I get—and they're highly delighted—</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>             <p>  They're highly delighted!</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>         <p> M.P.'s baronetted,
              Sham Colonels gazetted,
                   And second-rate Aldermen knighted—</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>              <p> Yes, Aldermen knighted.</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>              <p> They make for the Duchess!</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>          <p>Those pressing prevailers,
              The ready-made tailors,
                   Quote me as their great double-barrel—</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>              <p> Their great double-barrel—</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>          <p>I allow them to do so,
              Though Robinson Crusoe
                   Would jib at their wearing apparel—</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>               <p>Such wearing apparel!</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>         <p> At middle-class party
              I play at ecarte—
                   And I'm by no means a beginner—</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>          <p>We enjoy an interment.</p>

<h5>BOTH.</h5>         <p> In short, if you'd kindle
              The spark of a swindle,
                   Lure simpletons into your clutches—
                        Yes; into your clutches.
              Or hoodwink a debtor,
              You cannot do better</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>              <p> Than trot out a Duke or a Duchess—</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>                    <p>A Duke or a Duchess!</p>

<p>(Enter Marco and Giuseppe.)</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>  <p>Ah!  Their Majesties.  Your Majesty!  (Bows with
great ceremony.)</p>
