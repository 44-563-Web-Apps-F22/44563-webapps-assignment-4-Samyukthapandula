    <h3>The Gondoliers</h3>
    <h4>ACT II Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h4>
       <h4> SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
   Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
   occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
   are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
   etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
   degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
   distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
   reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.</h4>

   SONG—DUCHESS.

   <p>On the day when I was wedded
        To your admirable sire,
   I acknowledge that I dreaded
        An explosion of his ire.
   I was overcome with panic—
   For his temper was volcanic,
        And I didn't dare revolt,
        For I feared a thunderbolt!
   I was always very wary,
        For his fury was ecstatic—
   His refined vocabulary
        Most unpleasantly emphatic.
             To the thunder
                  Of this Tartar
             I knocked under
                  Like a martyr;
             When intently
                  He was fuming,
             I was gently
                  Unassuming—
             When reviling
                  Me completely,
             I was smiling
                  Very sweetly:
Giving him the very best, and getting back the very worst—
That is how I tried to tame your great progenitor—at first!
   But I found that a reliance
        On my threatening appearance,
   And a resolute defiance
        Of marital interference,
   And a gentle intimation
   Of my firm determination
        To see what I could do
        To be wife and husband too
   Was the only thing required
        For to make his temper supple,
   And you couldn't have desired
        A more reciprocating couple.
             Ever willing
                  To be wooing,
             We were billing—
                  We were cooing;
             When I merely
                  From him parted,
             We were nearly
                  Broken-hearted—
             When in sequel
                  Reunited,
             We were equal-
                  Ly delighted.</p>

                             RECITATIVE—DUKE.

    <p>To help unhappy commoners, and add to their enjoyment,
    Affords a man of noble rank congenial employment;
    Of our attempts we offer you examples illustrative:
    The work is light, and, I may add, it's most remunerative.</p>

                    DUET—DUKE and DUCHESS.

<h5>DUKE.</h5>         <p> Small titles and orders
              For Mayors and Recorders
                   I get—and they're highly delighted—</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>             <p>  They're highly delighted!</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>         <p> M.P.'s baronetted,
              Sham Colonels gazetted,
                   And second-rate Aldermen knighted—</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>              <p> Yes, Aldermen knighted.</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>              <p> They make for the Duchess!</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>          <p>Those pressing prevailers,
              The ready-made tailors,
                   Quote me as their great double-barrel—</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>              <p> Their great double-barrel—</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>          <p>I allow them to do so,
              Though Robinson Crusoe
                   Would jib at their wearing apparel—</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>               <p>Such wearing apparel!</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>         <p> At middle-class party
              I play at ecarte—
                   And I'm by no means a beginner—</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>          <p>We enjoy an interment.</p>

<h5>BOTH.</h5>         <p> In short, if you'd kindle
              The spark of a swindle,
                   Lure simpletons into your clutches—
                        Yes; into your clutches.
              Or hoodwink a debtor,
              You cannot do better</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>              <p> Than trot out a Duke or a Duchess—</p>

<h5>DUKE.</h5>                    <p>A Duke or a Duchess!</p>

<p>(Enter Marco and Giuseppe.)</p>

<h5>DUCH.</h5>  <p>Ah!  Their Majesties.  Your Majesty!  (Bows with
great ceremony.)</p>
